- When function calls itself called recursion.
- If bigger problem's solution depends upon similar small problem's solution

- Need base case for terminating the recursion

- Whenever we call the function it stores in the stack.

- Base case -> Processing -> Recursive relation --- Tail Recursion

- Base case -> Recursive relation -> Processing --- Head Recursion
